# Love Food Recipe Builder

This project is an application which includes a database of recipes that can be searched. When a user has registered and logged in to the application the user is able to create, update and delete their own recipes.

## UX

The project needs to be a web applicaition where users can log in to a recipe builder where they can create, store, edit and delete their own recipes. They will also have access to other users' recipes stored on the database. The user must be able to search by cuisine, country of orgin, allergens, ingredient or author of the recipe.
