# Love Food Recipe Builder

## What is it about?

I have developed this project using the skills learnt to build a Flask Website, using MongoDB. The application includes a database of recipes that can be searched by any user. When a user has registered and logged in to the application the user is able to create, update and delete their recipes. This project can be viewed at https://love-food-recipe-builder.herokuapp.com

## UX

The project needs to be a web applicaition where users can log in to a recipe builder where they can create, store, edit and delete their own recipes. They will have access to other users' recipes stored on the database. The user must be able to search by cuisine, allergens, ingredient or author of the recipe.
